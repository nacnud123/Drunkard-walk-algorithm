# Drunkard walk algorithm
 A C++ implementation of the Drunkard's walk algorithm
 I had originaly written this in GDScript for a project, then ported that code to C#, then I got really bored in class and decided to port it to C++.
 C++ is not my main language so there may be some non-standard stuff, but there are comments.
 Don't care if you use it, just like link to my github.
